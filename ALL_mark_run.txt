SQL> -- Q1. Data Manipulation (20 marks)
SQL> ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SQL> /*
SQL>(a) Load selected tables with your own additional test data: using the supplied Q1a-mc-insert.sql script 
SQL>file, and the SQL commands which will insert, as a minimum, the following sample data -
SQL>5 RESORTS,
SQL>20 CABINS,
SQL>25 BOOKINGS
SQL>15 REVIEWS
SQL>
SQL>Please note, these are the minimum number of entries you must insert; you are encouraged to insert more 
SQL>to provide a richer data set to draw from. The primary key values for this data must be hardcoded values 
SQL>(ie. not make use of sequences) and consist of values below 100. Dates used should be chosen after the 1st 
SQL>January 2019. 
SQL>
SQL>For this task ONLY, you may lookup and include values for the loaded tables/data directly where required. 
SQL>
SQL>The script must contain a single COMMIT statement as the last line of the script, ie. all listed actions 
SQL>should be treated as a single transaction.
SQL>
SQL>In carrying out this task you must not add any further data to tables which were previously populated by 
SQL>the supplied schema ﬁle.
SQL>For all subsequent questions (Q1b onwards) you are not permitted to manually:
SQL>- lookup a value in the database, obtain its primary key or the highest/lowest value in a column, or
SQL>- calculate values external to the database eg. on a calculator and then use such values in your 
SQL>answers.
SQL> 
SQL>You must ONLY use the data as provided in the text of the questions. Where a particular case for a word is 
SQL>provided you must use that case. You may divide names such as Garrot Gooch into a first name of Garrot and 
SQL>a last name of Gooch, if required. Failure to adhere to this requirement will result in a mark of 0 for the
SQL>relevant question.
